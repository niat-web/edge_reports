Apart from that, his code had a major flaw - sorting the input. I had told him not to go for sorting during our discussions but he still chose that route. Thus, his code would fault on a lot of test cases. Time complexity was also complex because of it. ",3,Once again he understood the problem quickly and told him his approach immediately. This was a classic Dijkstra's algorithm with a slight change.,3,"He quickly wrote his approach but the one thing that he did incorrectly was he made an early exit as soon as he found the destination node. This doesn't allow you to explore other paths that could have contributed to a higher probability. I did drop a hint by asking a follow-up question but he was firm and stood by it. Didn't pick on my hint that he was headed in the wrong direction. For storing probabilities, he used int rather than float - which is a minor error and can be looked over. Also, the graph construction should have used 'i' - again a minor error.",5,He took time but explained perfectly. I even gave a follow-up question to test if he had a strong DSA foundation - and he nailed it.,5,"Once again, he answered and backed it up with a strong reason. He did take time to explain it. Also, his entire appraoch wasn't too clear at the start, so I kept asking follow-up questions on how would he keep track of the data stream, once an element is popped from min-heap.

https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time/description/",1,Communication skills were poor. He was able to think of the approaches but was so hard to follow what he was saying. He needs clarity while explaining his thought process.,NA,3,"He understood the problem and explained his approach. But then again, it was hard to understand his approach. I tried multiple times to understand what he was saying, by asking follow up questions but that ended up taking a lot more time coz he wouldn't have patience to listen till I finished asking the question, and secondly he would keep repeating his sentences several times. past 15 mins, I asked him to stop explaining and start writing code. In my experience, this interview has been the most difficult to follow. ",2,"His code had major flaws - output order is incorrect (should be in descending order), works for normal test cases but fails for edge cases. It's close to optimal solution of bucket sort but could be better.",3,"He understood the problem very quickly and even identified the problem being a Dijkstra but then he was trying to build the graph using adjacency matrix which isn't efficient. This time I did not want him to waste time on explaining things that was difficult to understand so I asked him to start writing code, right after explaining the high-level of his approach.",1,"Unfortunately his code was nowhere near the optimal solution of using Dijkstra's algorithm. His code was more like a BFS traversal, treated it as an unweighted graph, used FIFO for addressing priority (rather than min-heap), incorrect indexing while relaxing an edge, no optimisation for visited nodes, etc,. I could go on over the list of errors forever.
Code had a lot of issues.",5,"He gave the right answer but it took him a lot of time to think + his explanation was extremely difficult to understand. Also whenever I would ask a follow-up question, he wouldn't listen to it carefully and end up giving a completely different answer. On top of it, he kept on repeating his sentences over and over again. He was also impatient to wait until I finished a question. At times he won't even know that both of us were talking about the same thing, coz he won't understand what question did I ask - this would again take a couple more mins. I gave him warnings from time to time to listen me carefully but it didn't work.",3,It was difficult to foolow his answer mid way through so I'm giving partial credits for telling me correct answer for the 1st half.,Candidate needs to practice coding to be able to come up with optimal solution in an interview. I would also highly suggest him to work on his communication skills and limit himself to 5-8 mins while explaining his appraoch and save 10-15 mins for writing the code (and not the other way around).,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wKRtj-db3twoJwh8oqW0w8Hf8WEfPvlD/view?usp=sharing,Medium Hire,Understands the Flow but Misses Key Details,Fullstack,50
